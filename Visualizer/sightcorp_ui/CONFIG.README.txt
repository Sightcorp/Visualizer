This document contains notes of things that may be useful for configuring the project.

1. In case virtual environment is needed, e.g., in order to use different
versions of python, django, etc. Do the following:

 - Assume the version is installed under virtualenv_django1.4
 - include system installed packages:
   e.g. virtualenv  --system-site-packages virtualenv_django1.4/
 - activate the virtual environment:
   e.g. source virtualenv_django1.4/bin/activate

2. run the django-admin.py to start up a project:
In my case, since virtural environment is used, it's under the virtualenv_django1.4/

3. If a database is only reachable via ssh, you need open a tunnel

4. project vs. app
 - the porject is django_ui
 - f4k_ui is an app; an app can live in anywhere in the python path, e.g., if we create it next to
manage.py, then it is a top-level module, instead of a sub-module of django_ui

5. When deploying:
 - copy the admin files to static, somehow it doesn't work if we don't do it
 - in wsgi.py, include the project directory in the sys path
